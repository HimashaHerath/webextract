# Workflow Backup Files

This directory contains backup copies of the original workflow files before the consolidation.

## Files

- `ci-old.yml` - Original CI workflow (200 lines)
- `code-quality-old.yml` - Original code quality workflow (157 lines)

## Context

These workflows were consolidated into a single `ci.yml` workflow to eliminate redundant code quality checks and improve efficiency.

**Issue Fixed:** Duplicate code quality checks across multiple workflows
**Solution:** Single consolidated workflow with optimized job dependencies

See `WORKFLOW_MIGRATION.md` in the root directory for detailed migration information.

## Safe to Remove

These backup files can be safely removed after confirming the new consolidated workflow is working correctly in production.
